	//we should probably have a function that allows the players to move their ships into different positions
	//at the beginning of the game and then have another function for the actual gameplay
	//im not sure what class to put these in yet so i am putting my thoughts here :)
	
	//I think we should make a barebones GUI first too to make it easier to test
